#Answer in Google's BigQuery SQL syntax:

with aggregate as (
select timestamp_trunc(date,day) as by_day
      ,count(distinct case when status = 'fraud' then store_id end) as fraud_ct_per_day
      ,count(distinct case when status = 'open' then store_id end) as active_store_ct_per_day
from table
where day >= timestamp_add(current_timestamp, interval -28 day)
group by 1
)
select by_day
,100.00*( fraud_ct_per_day / active_store_ct_per_day) as pct_fraud_per_day
from aggregate
order by 1 desc
