#Answer in Facebook's Presto SQL syntax(ANSI SQL Language):

with sequence as (
select avg(n) over(order by rnk asc rows between current row and 2 following) as moving_avg
from (
select n
      ,row_number() over() as rnk
from(
select array[4, 4, 4, 9, 10, 11, 12] as J
) as x(data)
cross join unnest(data) as t(n) ))

select min(moving_avg) as minn, max(moving_avg) as maxx from sequence

#Answer in Python using Pandas library!:

import pandas as pd
import nump as np

J = [4, 4, 4, 9, 10, 11, 12]

df = pd.Dataframe(J)
df['rolling_avg_3'] = df.iloc[:,0].rolling(window = 3).mean()

max_avg = df['rolling_avg_3'].max()
min_avg = df['rolling_avg_3'].min()
